# Submission Acknowledgement Notifier Plugin
Submission Acknowledgement Notifier Plugin for journal managers in OJS 3.3

This plugin re-enables the removed functionality in OJS 3.3 where journal managers (the primary journal contact) are BCC'd on submission acknowledgement emails. This plugin is only necessary for OJS 3.3 and should not be used with any other major version of OJS.

For more details on this functionality in previous and future versions of OJS, see the following Github issues:
- Discussion on removal of BCC for journal managers [(#7228)](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/7228)
- Submission acknowledgement re-added in OJS 3.4 [(#6272)](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/6272)
